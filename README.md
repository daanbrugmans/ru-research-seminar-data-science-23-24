# Research Seminar Data Science 2023/2024

This repository contains the completed assignments for the Radboud University (RU) course [NWI-IMC044 Research Seminar Data Science](https://www.ru.nl/courseguides/science/master/master-computing-science/specialisation-data-science/structure-master-specialisation-data-science/) for the school year 2023-2024 as made by [Daan Brugmans](https://github.com/daanbrugmans).
The Research Seminar is a mandatory part of the RU Data Science master where students learn to review academic papers and present their findings. 
The aim of the course is to familiarize students with the process of reviewing academic papers and recent advancements in the field of data science.

## D4Explainer
One of the assignments students must fulfill in the course, is the review and presentation of a recently published paper from a top-level data science conference.
In a team of two, I and Marieke van Vreeswijk reviewed the paper "D4Explainer: In-distribution Explanations of Graph Neural Network via Discrete Denoising Diffusion".
For publication information, please refer to the BibTeX provided below.
As part of the assignment, students are asked to investigate the reproducibility of the paper.
The [D4Explainer repository](https://github.com/Graph-and-Geometric-Learning/D4Explainer) is open-source and is included in this repository.
