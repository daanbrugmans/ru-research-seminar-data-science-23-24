# Task 2 Review of Paper 5 - What the DAAM: Interpreting Stable Diffusion Using Cross Attention

## 1. Summary
Rewrite this part of the paper more concisely (2 to 3 sentences):
<!-- In summary, our contributions are as follows:
(1) we propose and evaluate an attribution method,
novel within the context of interpreting diffusion
models, measuring which parts of the generated
image the words influence most; (2) we provide
new insight into how syntactic relationships map to
generated pixels, finding evidence for directional
imbalance in headâ€“dependent DAAM map overlap,
alongside visual intuition (and counterintuition) in
the behaviors of nominals, modifiers, and function
words; and (3) we shine light on failure cases in
diffusion models, showing that descriptive adjecti-
val modifiers and cohyponyms result in entangled
features and DAAM maps. -->
